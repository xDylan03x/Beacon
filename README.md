# Beacon
A new way for patients and their healthcare providers to communicate.

This project was developed for the 2024 Azalea Heath Hackathon hosted at VSU.
Team Members: Dylan Caldwell, Nicole Pratt

Beacon allows users to sign up as patients under their healthcare provider. They can then create and engage in conversations with their doctors. Doctors are also able to create conversations and interact with patients through a web-chat, phone calls, and video calls.
As an admin, you're able to create and manage users in the system.
